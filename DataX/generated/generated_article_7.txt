Exploring the Depths
 Caltech researchers led by John Dabiri create biohybrid robotic jellyfish to explore oceans and gather data on climate-related factors. The jellyfish, enhanced with electronics and a prosthetic "hat," swim more efficiently and can carry payloads. The innovation aims to revolutionize ocean exploration and data collection in a cost-effective manner.
