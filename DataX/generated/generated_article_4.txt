Fostering Collaboration
 Mathematicians increasingly rely on machine learning to solve complex problems. The Mathematics and Machine Learning 2023 conference at Caltech facilitates collaboration. Machine learning aids in tackling longstanding puzzles like the Riemann hypothesis and knot theory. Conversely, mathematics enriches machine learning algorithms, fostering innovation and deeper understanding.
