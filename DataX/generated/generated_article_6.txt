Illuminating the Microscopic
 Caltech researchers advance quantum imaging for biological samples using entangled photons, doubling resolution and preserving sample integrity. Quantum entanglement enables polarization control, aiding birefringent materials analysis. The technique, termed ICE, leverages virtual pinholes to enhance spatial resolution, offering insights into complex structures. Applications extend to space exploration via satellite-based measurements.
