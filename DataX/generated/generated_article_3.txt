From Neurons to Molecules
 Our brains reconstruct vivid memories from fragments, akin to assembling images from pixels. Similarly, molecules self-assemble into structures, reminiscent of neural networks. A recent study revealed that molecules, like neurons, exhibit associative recall, forming distinct shapes based on concentrations. This discovery hints at molecular systems' hidden computational prowess, echoing biological processes and offering insights into decision-making mechanisms.
